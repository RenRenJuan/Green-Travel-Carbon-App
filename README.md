GT2 Personal Carbon Calculator
==============================

  Features for the revived app.
   
* First buildout of same basic function as in e3fd46357085f9a8efde3cd4b94a5a4f211ee2e4 but with

   More parameters for the trip calc.

   Starter for the domain model.

* X Platform app for both Android and iOS

   Original was just Android and a proof of GPS (which still works). New version is react-native. 
   Initially just expo without native legs. There will be several iterations of the client before
   ...   

* Backend service available as in app purchase

   With typical cloud enhancements such as more context than a single trip, group aggregation, etc.
   The client itself with the basic trip model will remain free.
   
* FOSS as before

   Up to proprietary systems support in my other domains, this will remain fully open source.
   Initially it will be more of a vehicle for my development offerings but the intent is 
   develop a full featured Personal Carbon domain the client app of which will remain
   FOSS. There was a fee for the Android thing I think which I'll remove with the expo
   client.


2011 Stub App
=============
   
  Currently you need to do 'checkout e3fd46357085f9a8efde3cd4b94a5a4f211ee2e4' to get a working version
  matching what was on play since c. 4709.

  As of August 4719 it still loads in Android Studio, and it will be preserved in the repo.
