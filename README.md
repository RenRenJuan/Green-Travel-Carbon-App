Green Travel 2 Personal Carbon Footprint Calculator
==================================================

  Currently you need to do 'checkout e3fd46357085f9a8efde3cd4b94a5a4f211ee2e4' to get a working version
  matching what was on play since c. 4709.

  Features for the revived app (GT2)

* X Platform app for both Android and iOS

   Original was just Android 
   
* First Version just same but with a few more parameters for the trip calc.

   Original was just a proof of GPS (which still works). Subsquently a a full featured
   personal carbon domain with ...

* Backend service available as in app purchase

   Via a [servant](https://haskell-servant.github.io/) based API, with much additional stuff
   and as a showcase app in my infrastructure and praxis
   
* OSS as before

   Up to proprietary systems support in my other domains, this will remain fully open source.
   When I resumed this, I got the original state from the co above, will make sure that's
   preserved.
